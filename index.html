        <h1>THE MISSION</h1>   
        <p>Our mission is to help humans develop a great relationship with their canines. A dog is most receptive to communication when it is calm, well-exercised and actively engaged. And that’s where Adventure Dog comes in. We provide the kind of enrichment activities that make for a happy and healthy hound. This means a lot of positive reinforcement, socialization with a familiar pack, and a ton of exploration and physical activity in nature.</p>
        <h1>THE PHILOSOPHY</h1>
        <p>Adventure Dog uses the principles of behavioral science combined with an active, adventurous lifestyle. Being able to explore the sights, sounds, and smells of nature helps alleviate stress and fosters an attentive state of mind.<br><br>Our approach is positive reward-based conditioning first. We believe learning is best when learning is fun, and the data backs us up. An engaged dog that is receiving rewards, affection, and other positive incentives is much more likely to be motivated and excited when it’s time to learn. Good behavior breeds good behavior. Positive experiences with regular frequency provide a resonating feedback loop that builds and builds… and builds. Like working a muscle - the more you do it, the stronger you get.<br><br>We see through your dog’s eyes because communication is a two-way street. Understanding the way our canine friends communicate to us helps us interpret what they’re trying to say. Once we’re in sync with our pups, we can get them to do what they already want to do, but in a more appropriate way. All dogs want to be good dogs - they just need to know how.<br><br>Dogs benefit from routine - the socialization provided by a familiar pack gives a dog confidence and structure. A pack models appropriate behavior, provides engagement, and builds self-assurance, especially for dogs who might be a little timid or anxious.<br><br>Proper Polite Pooches don’t happen overnight, or in a vacuum. It takes work, patience, collaboration, and lots and lots of treats. That’s why we’re here to help!</p>

            <h2 class="profile-title">FOUNDER & TRAIL MASTER</h2>
            <p>
A San Francisco native and former motorcycle mechanic turned techie turned dog professional, Jim has a long history of figuring out how things work and what makes them tick. He’s been a professional dog walker for 3 years, and a dog dad for 6. Adventure Dog’s philosophy can be traced back to Jim’s innate curiosity and analytic nature - he strives to understand the whys of dog behavior, and then applies science and common sense to help build better relationships between dogs and their owners. Communication is key to any successful human-dog partnership, and Jim helps humans speak a language their dog can understand.</p>

            <h2 class="profile-title">CREATIVE & OPERATIONS</h2>
            <p>LeeJay has made a career out of wrangling creatives and refining workflow and design processes for a number of tech companies in the Bay Area. She likes to build things and solve problems. An organizer at her core, LeeJay seeks order in chaos, and patterns in seeming randomness. Applying these principles to dog behavior has helped bolster Adventure Dog’s scientific approach to healthy and happy human-dog communication. LeeJay has years of hands-on experience with strong breeds and “special needs” dogs - she has a soft spot for the dogs that struggle to fit in and function in what can sometimes be a rather overwhelming world.</p>

            <h2 class="profile-title">CHIEF NAPTIME OFFICER</h2>
            <p>Barney is Jim’s stalwart companion and trusty sidekick. He’s a trooper who will hike miles and miles on the toughest trails and still perk up if there’s even the slightest chance of going back O-U-T-S-I-D-E. If he’s not out on the trail, or playing fetch at the beach, Barney can always be found snuggled up in the coziest spot in the house, snuffling and snorting away in dreamland, chasing imaginary squirrels, and probably not catching them, just like in real life.</p>

            <h1 class="profile-name">MALCOM</h1>
            <h2 class="profile-title">ORIGINAL ADVENTURE DOG</h2>
            <p>Mal is the latest addition to the pack. He is LeeJay’s unintentional rescue pup, the (giant) little brother Barney never wanted, and the overgrown puppy that’s still working hard on his manners. He’s an energetic pooch who thrives on a ton of activity and engagement, but he missed out on socialization and, well, just learning how to be a dog. He is curious and playful and a never-ending fount of energy. Jim and LeeJay both realized the ability to spend time outdoors on daily hikes with the dogs was a privilege and a luxury - something all dogs deserved, but not all humans could give their canine companions every day. And thus Adventure Dog came to be.</p>
